     * <code>clientWidth</code> is the inner width of an element in pixels. It includes padding

     *
     * The property <code>innerWidth</code> is not useable as defined by the standard as it includes the scrollbars
     * which is not the indented behavior of this method. We can decrement the size by the scrollbar
     * size but there are easier possibilities to work around this.
     *
     * Safari 2 and 3 beta (3.0.2) do not correctly implement <code>clientWidth</code> on documentElement/body,
     * but <code>innerWidth</code> works there. Interesting is that webkit do not correctly implement
     * <code>innerWidth</code>, too. It calculates the size excluding the scroll bars and this
     * differs from the behavior of all other browsers - but this is exactly what we want to have
     * in this case.
     *
     * Opera as of 9.21 only works well using <code>body.clientWidth</code>.
     *
